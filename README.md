OpenEaagles 3rd Party Source
============================

The most current version of OpenEaagles can be found at [www.OpenEaagles.org][1].

* This package includes the source tar files for OE 3rd party dependencies.

* Make sure to use the version of JSBSim included in this archive when installing on a Linux-based computer. Many other dependencies can be install via “apt-get” or “yum” if Internet access is available.

* If you plan to use Clang to compile files, make sure to compile the provided libraries with that compiler - especially Google Protocol Buffers and install them into your own local library.

* To compile (by default) code with Clang, consider adding "export CC=clang" and "export CXX=clang++" to your .bashrc file"
